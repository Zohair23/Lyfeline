The LyfeLine project, developed by a team of 7, is a comprehensive library management system. It involved both front-end and back-end development, with a focus on creating a responsive and user-friendly interface while managing data with PostgreSQL.

The project provided valuable experience in user-centered design, database management, and integrating dynamic features like the 'Save for Later' button. It enhanced my skills in AJAX for real-time updates, troubleshooting third-party libraries, and ensuring smooth communication between the front-end and back-end.

Time management and adaptability were key throughout the process. Looking back, a stronger focus on accessibility and more frequent user feedback would have further improved the overall user experience.
